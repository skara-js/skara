## 🏛️ About Skara.js

Skara.js is a tiny front-end framework named after Skara Brae, the "Neolithic Pompeii" of the Orkney Islands. Just like that ancient settlement was built from humble materials but endured through millennia, Skara.js builds powerful modern applications from simple, foundational concepts.
