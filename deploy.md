## 🏛️ The Ancient Wisdom Approach

**Deploy thoughtfully, not frequently.**

Like the builders of Skara Brae, we should:
- ✅ **Plan** before building
- ✅ **Test** locally first  
- ✅ **Deploy** when ready
- ✅ **Preserve** resources for the long term

**The ancient stones don't need constant rearranging - they're built to last!** 🏛️✨
